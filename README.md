# TitleNameColorer
Automates adding loc flags that Colored Tiers (Titles) to landed title localization
This script will scan through all files in its Input folder looking for localizations that look like a landed title and apply the appropriate tags for that rank, before writing the updated localizations to a new file(s) that should overwrite just those lines.

## Usage:
1. Drop the localization folders from CK3 or its mod(s) into the Input folder.
2. Run TitleNameColorer.py
3. Copy the continence of the Output folder either a new mod or back into where you got the localizations from originally.
